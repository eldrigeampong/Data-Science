This number of non-displaced stateless persons is based on a registration and community legal assistance programme undertaken in West Malaysia by a local NGO with technical support from UNHCR, and, among those registered, 930 persons acquired Malaysian nationality in 2019. The total statelessness figure reported also excludes 101,326 stateless persons of Rohingya ethnicity who are also counted as refugees or asylum-seekers from Myanmar, mainly from Rakhine State. UNHCR�s statistical reporting generally follows a methodology that reports only one legal status for each person of concern. However, due to the size of the stateless Rohingya population displaced from Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual status of this population group as both displaced and stateless. This approach is being used for Malaysia for the first time in 2019.","United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Geneva, UNHCR Population Statistics Database, last accessed May 2021.",,

UNHCR�s statistical reporting generally follows a methodology that reports only one legal status for each person of concern. However, due to the size of the stateless Rohingya population displaced from Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual status of this population group as both displaced and stateless. This approach is being used for Sri Lanka for the first time in 2020.","United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Geneva, UNHCR Population Statistics Database, last accessed May 2021.",,
